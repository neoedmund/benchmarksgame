  <section>
    <h3 id="verify">Trust, but verify</h3>
    <p>You will probably come across stuff that people say about the benchmarks game. Do they show that what they claim is true? If they provide a URL, does the content actually confirm what they say?
    <p>Perhaps they are genuinely mistaken. Perhaps the content changed.
    <p>Sometimes people just make up stuff because the facts don't fit <b>the story they want to tell you</b>.

    <h3 id="jvm-startup-time"><q>Wtf kind of benchmark counts the jvm startup time?</q></h3>
    <p>Compare the times against [pdf] <a href="http://shipilev.net/talks/devoxx-Nov2013-benchmarking.pdf">Java Microbenchmark Harness</a> reports:

    <p>JVM start-up, JIT, OSR… are quickly effective and at most of these workloads are a miniscule factor. Note the exception.

    <h3 id="ridicule"><q> <q>Прогрелось</q>. Но работает минимум в 65x медленнее
– Поэтому супер-оптимизация…</q></h3>
    <p>No. The repeated measurements of the Java pi-digits program without restarting the JVM, were not a <q>super-optimization</q> to make the Java program at minimum 65x slower. 
    <p>That really would have been ridiculous. The JavaOne expert's slides mysteriously fail to show that the sum was correctly divided by 65 to give an average.

    <h3 id="dispute"><q>…to dispute a decision you basically need to pray the maintainer reopens it for some reason.</q></h3>
    <p>No. Followup comments can always be made in the project ticket tracker. There's a public discussion forum, etc. etc.
    <p>Someone's <q>brilliant hack</q> was rejected. Someone took the opportunity to push traffic to their personal blog.

  <section>
    <h3 id="name-game"><q>There's a reason they call it <q>a game</q>…</q></h3>
    <p>The name "benchmarks game" signifies nothing more than the fact that programmers contribute programs that compete (but try to remain comparable) for fun not money.

    <h3 id="history">Once upon a time…</h3>
    <p>Doug Bagley had a burst of crazy curiosity: <q><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010124090400/http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/">When I started this project</a>, my goal was to compare all the major scripting languages. Then I started adding in some compiled languages for comparison…</q> 
    <p>That project was abandoned in 2002, restarted in 2004 by Brent Fulgham and continued from 2008 by Isaac Gouy. Everything has changed; several times.
    <p>Oct 2014 through Sep 2015, Google Analytics shows 414,835 users.

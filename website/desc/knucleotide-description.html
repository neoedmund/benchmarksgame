    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>In practice, less brute-force would be used to calculate k-nucleotide frequencies, for example <a href="http://www.biorecipes.com/VirusClassification/code.html">Virus Classification using k-nucleotide Frequencies</a> and  [pdf 105KB] <a href="http://www.hicomb.org/HiCOMB2002/papers/HICOMB2003-03.pdf">A Fast Algorithm for the Exhaustive Analysis of 12-Nucleotide-Long DNA Sequences</a>.

    <h3>How to implement</h3>
    <p>We ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also <b>use the same algorithm</b> to calculate that result.
    <p>Each program should:
      <ul>
        <li><p>read line-by-line a redirected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasta_format">FASTA format</a> file from stdin
        <li><p>extract DNA sequence THREE
        <li><p><b>define a procedure/function</b> to update a hashtable of k-nucleotide keys and count values, for a particular reading-frame &#8212; even though we'll combine k-nucleotide counts for all reading-frames (grow the <b>hashtable</b> from a small default size)
        <li><p>use that procedure/function and hashtable to
           <ul>
           <li><p>count <b>all</b> the 1-nucleotide and 2-nucleotide sequences, and write the code and percentage frequency, sorted by descending frequency and then ascending k-nucleotide key
           <li><p>count <b>all</b> the 3- 4- 6- 12- and 18-nucleotide sequences, and write the count and code for the specific sequences GGT GGTA GGTATT GGTATTTTAATT GGTATTTTAATTTATAGT
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>diff</b> program output for this 250KB <a href="../download/knucleotide-input.txt">input file</a> (generated with the <a href="./performance.php?test=fasta">fasta program</a> N = 25000) with this <a href="../download/knucleotide-output.txt">output file</a> to check your program is correct, before you <a href="./play.html">contribute your program</a>.

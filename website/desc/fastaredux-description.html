    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Random DNA sequences can be based on a variety of [pdf 554KB] <a href="http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/pub/jvanheld/courses/regulatory_sequence_analysis/pdf_files/random_models.pdf">Random Models</a>. You can use Markov chains or independently distributed nucleotides to <a href="http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/rsat/random-seq_form.cgi">generate random DNA sequences online</a>.

    <h3>How to implement</h3>
    <p>We ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also <b>use the same algorithm</b> to calculate that result.
    <p>Each program should:
    <ul>
      <li><p>generate DNA sequences, by copying from a given sequence
      <li><p>generate DNA sequences, by weighted random selection from 2 alphabets
      <ul>
        <li><p>convert the expected probability of selecting each nucleotide into cumulative probabilities
        <li><p>encode the cumulative probabilities as blocks of duplicate lookup-table items
        <li><p>select an initial lookup-table item using a random number as an approximate index
        <li><p>match that random number against the cumulative probabilities to select the nucleotide
        <li><p>use this linear congruential generator to calculate a random number each time a nucleotide needs to be selected (don't cache the random number sequence)
<pre>IM = 139968
IA = 3877
IC = 29573
Seed = 42
 	
Random (Max)
   Seed = (Seed * IA + IC) modulo IM
   = Max * Seed / IM

      </ul>
    </ul>
